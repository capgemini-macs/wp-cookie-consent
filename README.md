# MACS Cookie Consent plugin

This plugin allows user to set up cookie preferences by accepting particular groups of cookies (`necessary` cookies are required)
 - `functional`,
 - `statistics`,
 - `targeting`,

More groups can be easily added with a bit of JS tweaks.

Cookies are then implemented by loading GTM containers dedicated to chosen group.

## Requirements
* WordPress 5.0+ 
* Fieldmanager plugin installed and activated (http://fieldmanager.org/)
